# Challenges: CSS Selectors

## CSS Diner

Solve the puzzles from the [CSS Diner game](https://flukeout.github.io/).

**Important:** It is currently not possible to select the **table** in the game.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Don't worry, some puzzles are based on really special selectors, you don't have to learn
> all of them.

## Personal Website

Continue to build your personal website. Include some of the selectors you learned today. For
example:

- create a decorator element with a `::before` selector
- style the `:link`, `:visited`, `:active`, `:hover` state of your links
- use combinators instead of classes if possible: `footer ul > li` instead of `.footer-list-item`

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Styling everything with combinators is equally as bad as styling everything with classes.
> Try to find a good balance between both.
