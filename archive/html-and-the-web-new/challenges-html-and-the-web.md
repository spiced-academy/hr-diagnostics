# Challenges: HTML and the Web

## `<div>`-Salad

Solve the _`<div>`-Salad_ challenge locally by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest spiced-academy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/html-and-the-web/div-salad
```

Replace all the div tags in the code with semantic HTML. In case you need some ideas, you can refer
to the handout.

## VS Code in the Cloud

With our first experiences in HTML, we can now start to build our own website. But before we do so, we need to set up our development environment. In this challenge, we will set up Visual Studio Code in the cloud, which is Codespaces on GitHub.
