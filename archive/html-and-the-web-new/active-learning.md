# Active Learning - HTML and the Web

Welcome to the first active learning session, focused on understanding the fundamentals of the web and the basics of HTML in a self-directed way. As a developer, one of the most valuable skills is the ability to teach yourself effectively, so let us take the first steps in that direction today.

The active learning process involves the following steps:

## 1. Read the document

Read the document and try to understand the content.

## 2. Dissect the examples

The document contains a lot of examples. Try to understand what is happening in the examples. They appear as you keep scrolling down the page.

## 3. Collect questions

As you read the document, you will probably have questions. Write them down in a text file or on a piece of paper. We will have time to discuss them later during the recap time.
