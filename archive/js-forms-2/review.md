# Review w. Spearmint

- seems like a little bit useless this lesson.
- different types were already shown
- required can also be shown before EASILY
- input event is just another event
- form.reset() was also been shown before

- on the other hand it was good, that they are seen everything combined again and how is working everything together:
  - creating the form
  - creating HTML validation
  - reacting to submit event
  - getting the data
  - and at the end creating new HTML elements

## Challenges

- Second task. Strange hint that I don't understand: `how to read and write the value of a form field. There's definitely a difference between the value of the event's target and the (after-event) value of your input field.`
