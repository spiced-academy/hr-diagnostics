  2. think of a **truth**
- Everyone presents both their lie and truth to the group
- The rest of the group has to guess what's the lie and what's the truth, for example:
  - Story Nr.1 is true ‚úÖ
  - Story Nr.2 is a lie ‚õîÔ∏è
- Afterwards, the "storyteller" will reveal what's the truth and what's the lie - there are no prizes, though üôÇ
