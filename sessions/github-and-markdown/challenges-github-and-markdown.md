# Challenges: GitHub and Markdown

## Github Profile

Your Github Profile is generally the first impression that other developers and future employers
will get of you. There is a simple way to enhance this profile with your individual style, namely
the so called **profile readme markdown file**. So let's build our very own personal profile page!

### Part 1

First we need a
[special repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
containing a file called **README.md**. This markdown file will later be displayed on your profile
page.

1. If not already done: create a GitHub account with a professional username (don't:
   superH4x0r_1337, do: mary-smith)
2. Create a new repository **with the same name as your GitHub username**. Choose not to include a
   README.md file.
3. Add a new README.md file and include a **level one heading** which welcomes visitors to your
   page. Commit your results directly to the main branch (we will explore later what that actually
   means).

Our setup is done. Let's see if it worked. Go to your profile page and check if the readme is
displayed there.

### Part 2

Just a simple welcome message does a poor job at describing who you are. Start to fill your profile
README with information. Tell the world who you are, what your interests are or in which profession
people can reach out to you for help. Include at least:

1. an interesting text / description about yourself,
2. a link to a picture / gif,
3. a list or table.

> ❗️ Commit after each step with a good commit message (see handout for how to write good commit
> messages).

### Part 3

Now visitors of your profile get a good overview about you, but plain markdown looks a bit boring.
Let's give your profile the final touch with some graphical elements!

1. Get some inspiration from this
   [List of awesome GitHub profile readmes](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme).

   > 💡 Hint: you can see the markdown code by opening the readme.md file and clicking the button
   > with the angle brackets "< >" ("showing the source blob")

2. Now it's your turn to implement some of these elements in your profile. Get crazy!
