# Student Recap

This afternoon, we have designated free sessions for you to utilize. It's an
opportunity to catch up on your progress and complete any pending challenges.
Your dedication to this course is commendable, and we encourage you to make the
most of this time.

**Here's how you can utilize this free session:**

1. **Challenges Completion:**
   - Finish any pending challenges you might have. This is a great time to
     ensure you are up-to-date with your coursework.
2. **Additional Activities (if you've completed all challenges):**

   - **Week 1:**

     - **Practice Git:** If you want to keep practicing git
       [here](./additional-challenge-git.md) you can found one more
       challenge.
     - **Practice HTML:** Create a new page and style it creatively. The
       page could be about:

       - a cinema / theater,
       - a restaurant,
       - a music band/ favorite singer,
       - a public administration office.

       Decide first the information you'll need / want to show, design your page structure (pencil and paper go a long way) and then work on the HTML.

       If you struggle with an idea of how to design your page, you can download this template.

   - **Week 4 & 5:** We have covered all the fundamental concepts of
     JavaScript. Challenge yourself by solving problems on

     to refine your skills.
   - **Week 6 & 7:** Dive into React! A valuable practice would be to
