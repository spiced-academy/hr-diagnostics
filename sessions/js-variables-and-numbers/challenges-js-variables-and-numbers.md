# Challenges: JS Variables and Numbers

## Data for a social media post üå∂Ô∏è

Solve the _Data for a social media post_ challenge by running this command in your Terminal:

```
npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-variables-and-numbers/social-media-post
```

Your task is to create various variables to store the data for a social media post.

## Tip Calculator üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

Create a program that calculates the total cost of a meal, including tip, based on the cost of the meal and the percentage of the tip.

### Steps

1. Create a new JavaScript file in VS Code.
2. Initialize a assign values to 2 variables:
   1. A variable which will hold the value of the meal cost.
   2. A variable which will hold the value of the tip percentage.
3. Calculate the tip amount by multiplying the meal cost by the tip percentage, and store the result in a variable called tipAmount.
4. Calculate the total cost of the meal, including tip, by adding the mealCost variable and the tipAmount variable, and store the result in a variable called totalCost.
5. Log out a message using the console.log() method that should look like this:
   // The total cost of your bill is: 33 euros

## Track Your Savings Goals üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

### Steps

1. Create a new JavaScript file in VS Code.
2. Set up three variables:
   1. startingBalance: Initialize this variable with your initial savings balance. For example, you can set it to 1000.
   2. monthlyContribution: Set this variable to the amount you plan to save each month.
   3. months: Specify the number of months for which you want to track your savings. For instance, you can set it to 12 for a year.
3. Calculate the total savings after the specified number of months by using the formula startingBalance + (monthlyContribution \* months) and store the result in a variable called totalSavings.
4. Print the result by using console.log to display the total savings you'll have after the specified number of months. For example:

   ```
   After 12 months of saving, you will have $4000 in your account.
   ```

5. Run your JavaScript program to see how much money you'll have saved after the specified time period.

## Calculate Circle Area and Circumference üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

### Steps

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
2. Initialize a variable to represent the radius of a circle. For example, you can set radius to a specific value, like 5.
3. Calculate the area of the circle using the formula [Math.PI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/PI) \* [Math.pow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow)(radius, 2) and store the result in a variable called circleArea.
4. Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula 2 _ [Math.PI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/PI) _ radius and store the result in a variable called circumference.
5. Display the results by logging them to the console. You can use console.log to print the area and circumference.
   For example:

```

For a circle with a radius of 5 units:

- The area is approximately 78.54 square units.
- The circumference is approximately 31.42 units.

```

6. Run your JavaScript program to see the calculated area and circumference of the circle with the specified radius.
