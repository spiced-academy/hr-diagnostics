## Variable Declarations

Variables are a `reference` or `alias` for data stored in memory. You can access this data by using
this variable. You can use three different keywords to declare a variable:

- `const` - declares a constant, the value can't be changed. `const` is the default way to declare variables. (Although strictly speaking, since their value cannot _vary_, they are not actually _variables_, but rather **constants**!). The constant's scope is limited to the current code block.
- `let` - declares a variable, the value can be changed. Should only be used when you will need to assign a new value to the variable later on. The variable's scope is limited to the current code block.
- `var` - declares a variable, the value can be changed. Should only be used when you will need to assign a new value to the variable later on. The variable's scope is limited to the current function.

We recommend that you use `const` and `let`. The use of `var` is less common, and should generally be avoided in favor of `const` and `let`. Going forward in our examples and challenges, we will use only `const` and `let`.

```js
const aNewConstant = 1234;
```

The keywords `let` (and `var` - see note above) are used when you will need to assign another value to this variable later on, for example to increase a counter.

```js
let counter = 0;
counter = counter + 1; // reassigning the value of counter
```

The `=` sign in programming doesn't quite work like the mathematical equality that you (maybe)
remember from school. It means: "the value of the item on the right of the equal sign is saved in
the item on the left of it". What the item on the right actually represents is calculated first and
saved afterwards.

## Primitive Data Types

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means, that you don't have to specify what kind of
value you want to store, JavaScript detects this automatically.

There are 7 primitive data types:

| type        | represents                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`    | a sequence of characters: "abcd"                                                                                            |
| `number`    | a number: 1234                                                                                                              |
| `boolean`   | a binary statement, can be `true` or `false`                                                                                |
| `null`      | represents "nothing", is typically set by developers                                                                        |
| `undefined` | represents the state of "not existing". Anything not specified or not found in JavaScript defaults to the value `undefined` |
| `BigInt`    | uncommon, used for integers larger than 9007199254740991                                                                    |
| `Symbol`    | uncommon, used for creating unique elements                                                                                 |

## Variable Naming

Expressive variable names are very important for the `readability of the code`. The Code becomes
easier to understand and needs less comments. There are some key guidelines you should follow when
naming a variable:

- use camel case: `socialFeedEntry` instead of `socialfeedentry`
- write out all words: `error` instead of `e`, `followerButton` instead of `flBtn`
- be very specific, longer names are better than shorter: `updatedFollowerCounter` instead of
  `counter`.

## Math & Operators

As a programmer you sometimes have to use mathematical operations to calculate certain widths or
positions of elements. Operators calculate values based on one or two expressions.

| operator | effect                                                                                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`      | adds two numbers together.                                                                   |
| `-`      | subtracts two numbers                                                                        |
| `*`      | multiplies two numbers                                                                       |
| `/`      | divides two numbers                                                                          |
| `**`     | potentiates two numbers: `2 ** 4 → 16`                                                       |
| `%`      | The remainder or modulus. Gives you what remains after a whole number division: `8 % 3 → 2`. |

The remainder is a very useful operator, but might be difficult to understand at first. A real life
example would be time on a clock. After noon, you don't reach 13am but you start over at 1pm. 3
hours after midnight you don't have 15pm (or 27h in the 24h format), but 3am. It is whatever hour we
have mod 12:

```js
5 % 12; // → 5
12 % 12; // → 0
13 % 12; // → 1
15 % 12; // → 3
27 % 12; // → 3
```

You can also use this operator to determine if a number is even or odd:

```js
6 % 2; // → 0
```

This is `0` for all **even** numbers, because after dividing an even number by `2` nothing remains.

```js
5 % 2; // → 1
```

This is `1` for all **odd** numbers, because after this division you have always `1` left over.

## Operator Precedence

In maths, some operators have a higher precedence than others. This means that they are performed
before operators with a lower precedence. For example, multiplication comes before addition.

> 📙 You can read more about [**Operator precedence** in the mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).

> 💡 If you are uncertain, use parentheses around calculations to denote precendence manually. Prettier
> will remove any unnecessary parentheses from your expression automatically.

## Assignment Operators

You already know the default assignment operator `=`. This operator just assigns the value on the
right to the element on the left. There are more assignment operators for very common actions like
increasing a variable by a fixed value.

| operator | effect                                                                                                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `+=`     | Increases the value of the variable on the left about the value on the right: `count += 6` → count is increased by 6 |
| `-=`     | Decreases the value of the variable on the left about the value on the right                                         |
| `*=`     | Multiplies the variable on the left with the value on the right                                                      |
| `/=`     | Divides the variable on the left with the value on the right                                                         |
| `++`     | Increments the value of a variable by one: `count++` → count is increased by one                                     |
| `--`     | Decrements the value of a variable by one: `count--` → count is decreased by one                                     |

## Type Coersion

When you use an operator with a variable with an unfitting type, JavaScript will automatically
convert (coerse) this variable into a fitting type. For example:

```js
4 / "2"; // → 4 / 2
```

There is no "/" operator for strings, so JavaScript converts the string into a number if possible.
This is also true for boolean operators which we will cover in a later session.

> ❗️ There is another `+` operator in JavaScript, that links two strings together: `"a" + "b"` →
> `"ab"`. When 'adding' a number and a string, the number is converted to a string: `"a" + 6` → `"a6"`.
> Make sure that both variables are numbers if you want to add them.

## Number Systems

When working with computers, it is sometimes useful to work with a different number system than the
standard 10 digit system, since a computer only understands `binary` numbers composed of only 0
and 1. You don't have to learn these systems by heart, but it is good if you heard about them.

- `decimal system`: the standard numbers, has 10 symbols "0" to "9".
- `binary system`: only has 2 symbols "0" and "1". If you want to write a bigger number than 1, you
  add another digit: 2 → "10" in binary.
- `hexadecimal system`: has 16 symbols "0" to "9" and "a" to "f". If you want to write a number
  bigger than 15 you add another digit: 12 → "c" in hexadecimal.
