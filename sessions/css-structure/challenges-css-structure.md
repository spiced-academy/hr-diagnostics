# Challenges: CSS Structure

## Selectors and Cascading Bugs

(difficulty: üå∂Ô∏è)

Solve the _Selectors and cascading bugs_ challenge by running this command in your Terminal:

```bash
npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-structure/selectors-and-cascading
```

Have a look at the `styles.css` file.

There are various CSS rule sets with `FIX_ME` as selector. Your task is to replace this placeholder
with a proper selector according to the description above the rule set.

Use regular selectors, you're not using BEM just yet. You do not need to touch the HTML file.

Try to get a sense of how you might encounter ambiguities or issues when choosing the right
selectors.

You can remove the `outline` style declaration once you fixed it's selector. It is only there to
check if you selected the correct elements.
