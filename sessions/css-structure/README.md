| 1:30     | Active Learning |
| 0:30     | Recap           |

## Learning objectives

- Understanding the CSS cascade
- Structuring CSS to improve maintainability and readability
- `@import` to import different CSS stylesheets in one file
- CSS practical strategies
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- BEM method

---

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ğŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- When writing CSS code things get messy really fast
- We need methods to organize our CSS code to avoid bugs and improve maintainability

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

- You need a basic understanding on how different CSS declarations are applied all together
- Working with today's methods will clearly improve your code

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block

How can we write well-structured, more readable and maintainable CSS code with fewer bugs?

---

## Activate prior knowledge of students

### Which previously learned concepts will be utilized in this session?

- HTML Basics
- CSS Basics

You can ask these questions:

- When you wrote CSS code before, which questions did you ask yourself while doing it?
  - How should I name this class?
  - Where should I put the code within the CSS file?
  - Why is this style declaration overwritten?
  - Can I avoid changing a certain color in different places manually?

## Inform: Session Guide

### CSS Cascade

- Introduce the students to the concept of "cascading" styles
  - CSS includes an algorithm that defines which CSS rules are being applied when there are conflicting rules.
  - Important concepts: `specificity`, `order`, `inheritance`
- Show an example for overwritten styles because of "cascading"
  - accidentally
  - on purpose

#### CSS Specificity

- Explain CSS specificity
  - The specificity of a CSS selector tells the browser which rule is most relevant for an element.
  - More specific rules win over less specific ones.
- Explain common types of selectors
  - Type selector
  - Class selector
  - ID selector
- Show an example for CSS specificity

    ```css
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }

    .headline {
      color: blue;
    }

    #main-headline {
      color: green;
    }
    ```

- Explain to avoid the `!important` flag

- it will overwrite all other styles and can lead to unexpected behavior

  ```css
   h1 {
    color: #ff4a11 !important;
   }
  ```

#### CSS Order

- Explain CSS order
  - When specificity is equal the order of CSS rules is relevant
  - CSS rules written further down in the document may overwrite
- Show an example for CSS order

  ```css
  h1 {
    color: red;
  }

  h1 {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

#### Inheritance

- Explain CSS inheritance
  - Some CSS properties get inherited from the parent element
  - Some examples are
    - font properties (font-family, font-size, font-weight, etc.)
    - list style properties (list-style, list-style-type, etc.)
    - color
    - cursor
    - visibility
  - Show an example for CSS inheritance

  ```css
  body {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

### BEM

- Explain the idea of the BEM method
  - Independent blocks and CSS selectors
  - Make your code reusable and modular
  - Code is easier to read and understand
  - Easier to scale, more robust and explicit
- Show website with [BEM introduction](http://getbem.com/introduction/)
- Explain the concept of BEM
  - **Blocks**:
    - Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own
    - Component
  - **Elements**:
    - A part of a block that has no standalone meaning
    - Is semantically tied to its block
  - **Modifier**
    - A flag on a block or element
    - Change appearance or behavior
    - (Visual) variant of something
- Show an example for BEM

  ```css
  .quiz-card {
    ...;
  }

  .quiz-card__question {
    ...;
  }

  .quiz-card__question--visible {
    ...;
  }
  ```

### CSS Structure best practices

- Explain why we need a consistent CSS structure
  - Code is more readable / easier to find code for a specific element
  - Important in a team of developers
- Explain concepts on how to create a structure
  - Create multiple CSS files (helps to improve overview)
  - Separate global and local styles
  - Create multiple stylesheets for different parts of your application
  - Separated, reusable components
- Mention that it's important to have a team-agreed strategy and that there are various established manifestos (e.g. BEM)
- Show an example of a possible structure
  - create a `css` directory
    - `styles.css`
    - `global.css`
    - `pages/home.css`
    - `components/quiz-card.css`
- Show the `@import` statement
  - `@import 'components/quiz-card.css';`

### Custom Properties

- Discuss the concept of variables
  - A value stored with a name that is reusable
  - The name is a reference to the value
  - Example: contacts in an address book (remember a person's name instead of the phone number)
- Complex websites have a lot of repeating values
  - colors, fonts, border radius size, shadows, spacing size
- Define custom properties:
  - Example: `--primary-color: #ff00ff;`
  - Important: custom property must start with two dashes & naming is case sensitive
- Access custom properties:
  - Example: `color: var(--primary-color);`
- Common practice:
  - Define custom properties with the `:root` pseudo-class as selector
  - Makes the values available globally
- Optional: discuss inheritance and how to overwrite custom properties

## Process: Challenges

- Provide the [handout](css-structure.md) and the [challenges](challenges-css-structure.md) to
  the students
- Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- Divide the students into groups
- Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ğŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- Highlight the progress made that day
- Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap

cascading, specificity, BEM, @import, custom properties

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.
