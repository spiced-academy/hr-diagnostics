## How many different values can a boolean have?

* [ ] 1
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [ ] 4

type: multiple_choice

## Which of the following values is `falsy`?

* [ ] `-23`
* [ ] `"falsy"`
* [ ] `true`
* [x] `""`

Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: Nope! An empty string `""` is a `falsy` value.

type: multiple_choice

## Which of the following values is `truthy`?

* [ ] `undefined`
* [ ] `""`
* [ ] `0`
* [x] `-23`

Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.

type: multiple_choice

## Given is: `x === y`. Which of the following statements is correct?

* [ ] Both `x` and `y` are equal in data type only.
* [ ] Both `x` and `y` are equal in value only.
* [x] Both are equal in value and data type.
* [ ] `x` and `y` are completely different.

Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: Nope! The strict equality operator (`===`) compares two operands for equality. If both operands have the same data type and value, they are considered equal.

type: multiple_choice

---

## You want to check if the variable `x` is not equal to `null`. Choose the correct code snippet: 

* [ ] `if (x!)`
* [x] `if(x !== null)`
* [ ] `if (x!null)`
* [ ] `if (!x)`

Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: Nope! With `if(a !== null)` you can check if the variable `x` is not equal to `null`. 

type: multiple_choice

---

## Which of the following is not a logical operator?

* [ ] `&&`
* [ ] `||`
* [ ] `!`
* [x] `?`

Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: Nope! `&&` AND, `||` OR and `!` NOT are logical operators.

type: multiple_choice

## Which of the following statements about `if` statements is wrong?

* [ ] The `if` statement executes a statement if a specified condition is truthy.
* [ ] The `if` statement may contain an optional `else` block which executes when the condition is falsy.
* [x] An `if` statement always needs an `else` block which executes when the condition is falsy.


Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: Nope! The `if` statement doesn't necessarily need an `else` block.

type: multiple_choice

## Given is: `const age = 19` and `const isOldEnough = (age > 18)` - Which value has the variable `isOldEnough`?

* [x] `true`
* [ ] `false`
* [ ] `19`
* [ ] `18`


Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: No, the value of `isOldEnough` is `true`.

type: multiple_choice

---

## Given is: `const fancy = false` and `const color = fancy ? 'steelblue' : 'papayawhip'` - Which value has the variable `color`?

* [ ] steelblue
* [x] papayawhip

Points: 1

Feedback_correct: That's right.
Feedback_incorrect: No, the value of `color` is `papayawhip`.

type: multiple_choice
