# Review w. Spearmint

- session analogy example with the carrots is imo just bad. Lets try to think of something more useful. Maybe introduce Math.random() for this class? Then the if-statement would make actually sense.

- first challenge is confusing. It doesnt tell you to open the index.html in the README and to fill out the points. When you fill out and adjust the JS the page is reloaded -> all your progress is lost.
- 2-4 challenge is introducing functions and return values on codewars --> not ideal
- last challenge is introducing logical operator like && without discussing it in session. Also it does not tell you to open index.html and we work a lot with DOM elements and events already --> not ideal
