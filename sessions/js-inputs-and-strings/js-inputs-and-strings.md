## Strings

There are three ways to create strings using _string literals_:

1. `'string'`: single quotes
2. `"string"`: double quotes
3. `` `string` ``: back ticks or **template literals**.

> ðŸ’¡ In general there is no preference for using either single or double quotes, except for stylistic
> reasons. Tools like prettier convert all strings to use the same style quotes. We have configured
> prettier to use double quotes by default. One reason to prefer one style of quotes over another on
> a case-by-case basis is when a quotation mark is part of the string:
>
> - `"It's such a nice day!"`
> - `'"Nice work", they said.'` or `'[data-js="foo"]'`
>
> Prettier detects these cases automatically.

Strings can be chained together by using the `+` operator (yes, the same as the maths operator).
This is called **string concatination**:

```js
const name = "Alex";
const stringConcatination = "Hello " + name + ", good to see you!";
```

## Template Literals

The third method to write strings has the useful property that you can insert variables into the
string by wrapping placeholders with a dollar sign and curly brackets `${}` . This is also called
**string interpolation**.

This way you don't have to concat multiple strings if you want to use a variable in your string:

```js
const stringConcatination = "Hello " + name + ", good to see you!";

const withTemplateString = `Hello ${name}, good to see you!`;
```

Any **expression** can be placed into these placeholders:

```js
const greeting = `Hello ${
  name !== null ? name : "mysterious person"
}, good to see you!`;
```

With template literals you can also write **multi-line strings**:

```js
`Hello,
this is in a new line.
Good bye!`;
```

## String Properties and Methods

Strings in JavaScript have some build-in **properties** and functionalities called **methods**. You
can call them with the dot notation followed by the name of the property / method.

```js
"A normal string".length; // evaluates to 15
"A normal string".toUpperCase(); // evaluates to "A NORMAL STRING"
```

> ðŸ’¡ Methods are functions, thus they need to be invoked by placing `()` brackets after the name of
> the method.

| Property / Method                   | Effect                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.length`                           | returns the number of characters in a string.                            |
| `.toUpperCase()`                    | returns a all uppercase version of the string.                           |
| `.toLowerCase()`                    | returns a all lowercase version of the string.                           |
| `.trim()`                           | returns a string with all whitespace removed from the beginning and end. |
| `.replaceAll(oldString, newString)` | replaces all occurrences of `oldString` with the `newString`.            |
| `.startsWith(subString)`            | returns `true` if the string starts with subString.                      |
| `.endsWith(subString)`              | returns `true` if the string ends with subString.                        |
| `.includes(subString)`              | returns `true` if the string contains the subString.                     |

## Input Fields

Every input field in HTML holds a **value** in form of a string. You can access the value by using
`.value` on the input Element:

```html
<form>
  <input data-js="textInput" type="text" value="test 123" />
  <input data-js="numberInput" type="number" value="42" />
</form>
```

```js
const textInput = document.querySelector('[data-js="textInput"]');
const numberInput = document.querySelector('[data-js="numberInput"]');

textInput.value; // evaluates to 'test 123'
numberInput.value; // evaluates to '42' (still a string!)
```

You can also change the value of the input by assigning a new value to this input property:

```js
textInput.value = "changed value!";
```

This change is immediately visible on the website.

For example, you can enforce all uppercase letters in a form by combining this functionality with an
`input` event listener on the input element:

```js
// transform on every change the input value to uppercase letters
textInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
  const oldValue = textInput.value;
  const newValue = oldValue.toUpperCase();
  textInput.value = newValue;
});
```
