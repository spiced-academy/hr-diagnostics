# Active Learning - JS Inputs and Strings

Welcome to yet another active learning session focused on learning how Inputs and Strings are used in JavaScript in a self-directed way. We know: as a developer, one of the most valuable skills is the ability to teach yourself effectively, so let's take some more steps in that direction.

> The active learning process involves the following steps:

## 1. Read the document

Read the document and try to understand the content.

## 2. Dissect the examples

The document contains a lot of examples. Try to understand what is happening in the examples. They appear as you keep scrolling down the page.

## 3. Collect questions

As you read the document, you will probably have questions. Write them down in a text file or on a piece of paper. We will have time to discuss them later during the recap time.
