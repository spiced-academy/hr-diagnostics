# CSS Responsive

## Active Learning

This is an Active Learning session for the students. That means that the coach assigned to the session only needs to provide a brief 5-10 minute intro. Old session guide is retained below incase it is decided to be used as a one off.

- [ ] Intro topic for 5 - 10 mins
- [ ] Share [Active Learning Guide](active-learning.md) with the students.
- [ ] Share [Challenges](challenges-css-responsive.md) with the students.

## Active Learning Intro

- Our websites should be able to adjust and look good on a wide range of devices, ranging from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- Additionally, we need to consider accessibility features that might impact the way a website is shown.

  - high contrast mode
  - reducing animations.

- [ ] **Demo Non-Responsive Website:** Show an example of a website that doesn't adapt to various screen sizes. You can use [this example](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-non-responsive).

- [ ] **Contrast with Responsive Website:** Compare it with a website that effectively responds to different screen sizes, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or any other modern website you prefer for demonstration purposes.

  Alternatively, you can use [the same example as above, but the responsive version](https://dequeuniversity.com/library/responsive/1-responsive).

In this Active Learning session, we will explore two important tools that help us create responsive websites.

- [ ] **Media Queries**

  - A vital component within CSS tools
  - Enable us to apply styles based on the device's characteristics
    - Screen size
    - Resolution
    - Orientation (portrait or landscape on smartphones)
  - Media queries ensure our site's layout and appearance adapt effectively to various devices.

- [ ] **Responsive Units**
  - Allow elements to dynamically adjust their size using specific reference points
  - Ensure content looks appropriate across a range of devices

## Arrival: Motivate students and prepare them for today's topic(s)

> ðŸ’¡ Breathe and relax :)

### Which important problem will we solve today?

- Our Websites need to adapt responsively to a wide variety of devices
  - from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- There are accessibility features that can also affect how a website should be displayed
  - high contrast mode
  - reducing animations.

Media queries and relative units help to accomplish this.

### Why is the content of today's block that important for the students?

- Responsive design allows users to view your website on a **wide variety of devices**.
- It also ensures **accessibility to all users**.

### Pose a question to be answered by the end of the block!

How can we use CSS to react to different features of the medium that our website is being viewed on?

## Inform: Session Guide

### Responsive Design

- [ ] Use the following static example and show how it behaves on different screen sizes
      npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-responsive/demo-example-static
- [ ] Explain that this site does not respond to different screen sizes
- [ ] Show this [responsive example](https://r4djc5.csb.app/) and compare how _it_ behaves on different screen sizes. Check out the source by executing:

      npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-responsive/demo-example-responsive

- [ ] Explain that responsive design is a design that adapts to the screen size of the device it is being viewed on
- [ ] It can also mean adapting to other factors like orientation, color scheme, or accessibility needs
- [ ] Explain that it is a design principle that is very important as most people use mobile devices
      to access the web

### Responsive Units

- [ ] Explain that relative units are units that are relative to the size of the screen, the font
      size, or the size of the parent element
- [ ] Explain that the most common relative units are `vh`, `vw`, `em`, `rem`, and `%`. The `calc()`
      function can help combine multiple units and do math
- [ ] Open the browser and walk students through the current state of the demo.
- [ ] Explain the relative units step by step.

Show the demo and go through the different units and explain their behavior with:

      npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-responsive/demo-start

You can find the final state of the demo with:

      npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/css-responsive/demo-end

#### Percentage: `%`

- [ ] Explain that the percentage unit indicates how large an element is in relation to its parent element.
- [ ] Show that the `.box--percent` currently does not change when adjusting the screen because of its `width: 100px`.
- [ ] Set the `width` to `50%` and explain the behavior:
  - [ ] The blue box takes up 50% of the width of the parent element (the grey box).
  - [ ] Adapting the screen size will change the blue box, but it always has 50% width of the parent container.

```css
.box--percent {
  ...
	width: 50%;
	height: 100px;
}
```

#### Viewport Width: `vw`

- [ ] Explain that the `vw` unit is relative to the width of the screen (and not the parent element as `%`).
- [ ] Note that we set the exact value by an integer between 1 and 100:
  - [ ] `25vw` mean 25% of the entire screen width.
- [ ] Set the `width` of the `.box--vw` to `50vw` and show the difference to the `.box--percent`.

```css
.box--vw {
  ...
	width: 50vw;
	height: 100px;
}
```

#### Viewport Height: `vh`

- [ ] Explain that `vh` behaves the same as `vw`, but according to the `height`:
  - [ ] it takes an integer between 1 and 100
  - [ ] the value indicates what percentage of the screen height the element occupies
- [ ] Adapt the `width` property of `.box--vh` to occupy 50% of the screen height.
- [ ] Show that changing the height of the screen (i.e. the CodeSandbox Browser) will change the `width`

```css
.box--vh {
  ...
	width: 50vh;
	height: 100px;
}
```

#### Measuring according to font size: `em`

- [ ] Explain that `1em` corresponds to the font size of
  - [ ] the parent element in case of typographical properties like `font-size` or
  - [ ] the current element itself in case of other properties like `width`.
- [ ] Note that this allows for flexible and scalable typography or you want the padding of something stays always the same according to the size of the font.
- [ ] Explain that you want the `width` and `height` of `.box--em` to be 5 times as the font size (`32px`), 160px in total.
- [ ] Show that changing the font-size will change the measures of the box as well.

```css
.box--em {
  font-size: 32px;
  width: 5em;
  height: 5em;
}
```

#### Using the font size of the root element: `rem`

- [ ] Note that there is a quite similar relative unit called `rem`.
- [ ] Explain the difference to `em`: it takes the `font-size` of the root element of the document.
- [ ] This font-size is either declared in the `html` tag or uses the default browser font size (in Firefox it is 16px).
- Show how to set the `width` and `height` of the `box--rem` element to 80px using `rem`:

```css
.box--rem {
  font-size: 32px;
  width: 5rem;
  height: 5rem;
}
```

- [ ] Show that changing the `font-size` for this element does not affect its size.
- [ ] Now change the `font-size` of the root `html` element to `20px` and show the difference (the pink box should now have 100px):

```css
html {
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

#### Calculating values with `calc()`

- [ ] Explain that the `calc()` function lets us do math and use the learned relative units to create the value we need for width or/and height.
- [ ] Show how to calculate the `width` to be half as wide as the parent element minus two times the current font size:

```css
.box--calc {
  font-size: 32px;
  width: calc(50% - 2em);
  height: 100px;
}
```

### Media Queries

- [ ] Explain that media queries are a way to target different

  - media types
  - screen sizes
  - orientations
  - color schemes
  - accessibility needs (prefers-reduced-motion, etc.)
  - pointer device types.

- [ ] Explain that you want to meet the requirements of the `.box--min-width`:
  - [ ] We need to distinguish between `200px` and `400px` depending on a condition (`min-width` of `768px`).
  - [ ] Explain that we can use the `@media` at-rule to check for this condition and specify the CSS rules which should be applied.
  - [ ] Note that we only need to put the properties that change in the media query.

```css
.box--min-width {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .box--min-width {
    width: 400px;
  }
}
```

- [ ] Show how to combine multiple min-width media queries
  - [ ] Explain the requirements of the `.box--min-width-2`.
  - [ ] Note that it's easier to start with the smallest screen size and work your way up:

```css
.box--min-width-2 {
  background-color: lightcoral;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100px;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .box--min-width-2 {
    width: 75%;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .box--min-width-2 {
    width: 300px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}
```

- [ ] Explain that media queries are not only used for screen sizes, but also for other factors like
      orientation, color scheme or accessibility needs.
- [ ] Add the code to meet the requirements of the `.box--color-scheme`.
- [ ] Change your preferred color scheme in your operating system to see how it works.

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .box--color-scheme {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

### Mobile First Design

- [ ] Since most people use mobile devices to access the web, it is a good idea to design for mobile
      first
- [ ] By starting small and then adding more complex layouts as the screen size increases, you can
      ensure that the most important content is always visible first

### Mobile First CSS

- [ ] Explain that mobile first CSS is a convention that is used to make it easier to reason about
      the CSS structure
- [ ] You can start with the smallest screen size and then add more complex CSS as the screen size
      increases

### Responsive Images

- [ ] Explain that the handout contains a section about changing images based on media queries
      (using the `picture` element) and that this will be part of a bonus challenge.

---

## Process: Challenges

- [ ] Provide the [handout](css-responsive.md) and the [challenges](challenges-css-responsive.md) to
      the students
- [ ] Open the handout and walk the students through the tasks
- [ ] Divide the students into groups of ~4
- [ ] Remind them of the ground rules:
  - meet again 30 min before lunch break in the class room
  - they can ask the coaches for help at any time
  - always try to help each other
  - take a break within the next 1.5 hrs
  - keep an eye on Slack

---

## Evaluate: Recap of the assignment / Discussion of the MVP / Solution

- Revisit the question that was posed in the beginning of the session and try to answer it with a
  few phrases.

---

## Checkout

> ðŸ’¡ In case the students seem frustrated try to find some encouraging words (e.g. remind them of
> how far they have come already) :)

- [ ] Summarize the day by repeating all of the topics that were discussed
- [ ] Highlight the progress made that day
- [ ] Encourage the students to repeat what they learned with practical exercises
- [ ] Remind them to rest :)

## Keywords for Recap:

@media, responsive design, mobile first, vh, vw, em, rem, %, calc(), media queries, min-width

> These keywords are for the weekly summary on Fridays. We use the keywords to automatically
> generate excalidraw tags with the help of
> [this amazing tool](https://github.com/F-Kirchhoff/tag-cloud-generator). The students structure
> the cards in a pattern that makes sense for them. Each tag, that is added to the structure needs
> to be explained in a few words by one student. We go in rounds one by one until all tags are
> included in the structure.
