## Basic form setup

### `<form>` tag

The `<form>` tag must be wrapped around the complete form with all elements, that are presented as
form controls to the user.

```html
<form>
  <!-- All form elements inside -->
</form>
```

### Form field names

Forms are created to request information from the user. Each fragment of information (each form
field) requires a unique name. It can be set with the `name` attribute and pairs up with the entered
data, when submitting the form.

```html
<input name="first-name" />
```

### Labels

The `<label>` always goes together with a form field. It provides a caption to let users understand,
what kind of data they are asked to enter.

It is required to define, which label and form field belong together. Use the `for` attribute on the
`<label>` and the `id` attribute on the form field. Their values needs to match.

```html
<label for="first-name">First name</label>
<input name="first-name" id="first-name" />
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Always add a label to a form field. Otherwise users won't understand the purpose of a field,
> which makes it unusable.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Never use the `placeholder` attribute instead of a label.

## Different types of form fields

### Text

The default `type` for `<input>` elements is `text`. Choose the `type` based on the kind of data the
user is requested to enter. Use `type="text"` when none of the other types is a better fit.

```html
<label for="first-name">First name</label>
<input type="text" name="first-name" id="first-name" />
```

### Email

Use `type="email"` to let the user enter an email address. The browser can check automatically,
whether the entered text is a valid email address. .

```html
<label for="email-address">Email address</label>
<input type="email" name="email-address" id="email-address" />
```

### Number

Use `type="number"` to let the user enter a number.

```html
<label for="age">Age</label> <input type="number" name="age" id="age" />
```

### Date

Use `type="date"` to let the user enter a date with the help of a date picker (calendar) provided by
the browser.

```html
<label for="date-of-birth">Date of birth</label>
<input type="date" name="date-of-birth" id="date-of-birth" />
```

### Color

Use `type="color"` to let the user enter a color with the help of a color picker tool provided by
the browser.

```html
<label for="favorite-color">Favorite color</label>
<input type="color" name="favorite-color" id="favorite-color" />
```

### Multi-line text

Use the tag `<textarea>` to let the user enter longer text with multiple lines.

```html
<label for="personal-message">Personal Message</label>
<textarea name="personal-message" id="personal-message"></textarea>
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Please be aware that the `<textarea>` tag is not a self-closing tag like `<input>`.

### Select / dropdown menu

The `<select>` field lets the user choose between different options wrapped into `<option>` tags
that are nested into their parent `<select>` tag - this renders a dropdown menu. Each `<option>` has
a `value` attribute defining the data to be submitted. The option's text presented to the user is
defined between the opening and closing tag.

```html
<label for="billing-plan">Billing plan</label>
<select name="billing-plan" id="billing-plan">
  <option value="weekly">Weekly billing</option>
  <option value="monthly">Monthly billing</option>
  <option value="yearly">Monthly billing</option>
</select>
```

### Radio elements

The `<input type="radio" />` element is another way of presenting a choice with different options to
the user. In many situations it can be used as an alternative to `<select>`.

```html
<input
  type="radio"
  name="billing-plan"
  id="billing-plan-weekly"
  value="weekly"
/>
<label for="billing-plan-weekly">Weekly billing</label>

<input
  type="radio"
  name="billing-plan"
  id="billing-plan-monthly"
  value="monthly"
/>
<label for="billing-plan-monthly">Monthly billing</label>

<input
  type="radio"
  name="billing-plan"
  id="billing-plan-yearly"
  value="yearly"
/>
<label for="billing-plan-yearly">Yearly billing</label>
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏è The `name` attribute must be equal among all radio elements that refer to the same choice. The
> browser groups them together and ensures only one radio element can be selected at the same time.

### Checkboxes

In contrast to the radio element, `<input type="checkbox" />` presents individual choices, that are
not related to each other. Each choice can either be "on" ("true") or "off" ("false").

```html
<input type="checkbox" name="accept-data-privacy" id="accept-data-privacy" />
<label for="accept-data-privacy">I accept the data privacy agreement</label>

<input
  type="checkbox"
  name="accept-terms-conditions"
  id="accept-terms-conditions"
/>
<label for="accept-terms-conditions">I accept the terms and conditions </label>
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏è The `name` attribute must not be equal among the checkbox elements. They are used to represent
> individual choices.

### More form field types

The different types of `<input>` elements described above is just a small selection. Please refer to
the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) to see a
complete list of all types with examples.

### HTML Form Validation

Before submitting a form, it is important to ensure all required form fields are filled out, in the
correct format. This is called **client-side form validation**.

HTML provides several form field attributes to enable validation features build into the browser.

| Attribute                 | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `required`                | if present, a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted                                                                    |
| `minlength` / `maxlength` | minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)                                                                                               |
| `min` / `max`             | minimum and maximum values of numerical input types                                                                                                |
| `type`                    | each input type has its own prefigured validation (like `email`)                                                                                   |
| `pattern`                 | [a regular expression pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) the entered data needs to follow |

Example: The following input field is valid if its value exists and it is a string between 3 and 30
characters:

```html
<input
  id="input-name"
  type="text"
  name="name"
  minlength="3"
  maxlength="30"
  required
/>
```

### Default Behavior of Form Submit

If you click the submit button of a form, it triggers the following default behavior (which we will change in the future using JavaScript):

- The form sends a GET request with names and their values as prop inside an URL like
  `/?firstName=value1&lastName=value2&...`.
- The page is reloaded and thus the data is lost for us.

---

## Buttons

### Submit button

The default `type` for a `<button>` element is `submit`. It is used to let users submit the form's
data after they filled out all fields.

```html
<button type="submit">Send</button>
```

> üí° Since it's the default, it would work the same without the type attribute:
> `<button>Send</button>`.

### Reset button

A button with `type="reset"` lets the user reset all form fields to the their default value on
click.

```html
<button type="reset">Reset all fields</button>
```

### Other buttons

Since `type="submit"` is the default for `<button>` elements, buttons outside of a `form` element
should always be defined with `type="button"` to be semantically correct.

```html
<button type="button">Click here for more information</button>
```

This also applies to buttons with diverging functionality within a form.

## Form structure and a11y

### Fieldset and Legend

The `<fieldset>` element is used to group multiple fields together. Use the `<legend>` element to
provide a caption for such a group.

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Personal information</legend>

  <label for="first-name">First name</label>
  <input type="text" name="first-name" id="first-name" />

  <label for="email">Email address</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
</fieldset>
```

### `aria` labels

#### aria-label

The `aria-label` attribute defines a label for an interactive element. Use it when the accessible
name is missing and there is no content visible in the DOM that can be referenced via the
`aria-labelledby` attribute, e.g. a button with no text but only an icon:

```html
<button aria-label="Close form" onClick="...">
  <svg ...><path ... /></svg>
</button>
```

#### aria-labelledby

The `aria-labelledby` attribute identifies which element labels the element it is applied to. Use
the `id` attribute to create the connection:

```html
<h2 id="title">Personal Information Form</h2>
<form aria-labelledby="title">...</form>
```

#### aria-describedby

The `aria-describedby` attribute allows more verbose information than a label. Use the `id`
attribute to create the connection:

```html
<p id="description">
  We need some personal information about you in order to proceed. Please fill
  in this form so that we can help you.
</p>
<fieldset aria-describedby="description">...</fieldset>
```
