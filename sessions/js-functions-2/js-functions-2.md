## Return Statements

Functions are an incredible versatile and central tool in most programming languages. We already
learned how to pass values into a function with input parameters. But a function can also return a
value back to the place where it was called. This is done via a `return statement`.

```js
function add3Numbers(first, second, third) {
  const sum = first + second + third;
  return sum;
}
```

The `return statement` begins with the keyword `return` followed by an expression. This this case,
the expression is the variable sum. Its value is returned by the function and can be stored when the
function is called:

```js
const firstSum = add3Numbers(1, 2, 3);
// the return value is stored in "firstSum", namely 6

const secondSum = add3Numbers(4, 123, 33);
// the return value is now stored in "secondSum", namely 160
```

> 💡 An expression is anything that produces a value: a variable, a hardcoded value like `true` or
> `6`, a math operation like `2 + 3` or even another function call!
> [This article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/javascript/statements-vs-expressions/) explains this in
> greater depth.

By this, we can outsource computations and / or decision processes and continue using the returned
value in the program.

A function can return only one expression value, but can have multiple return statements, in
combination with if else statements for example:

```js
function checkInputLength(inputString) {
  if (inputString.length > 3) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Early Return Statements

As soon as a return statement is reached in a function call, the function execution is ended. The
following `console.log()` is therefore never reached:

```js
function testFunction() {
  return "a returned string";

  console.log("I am never logged in the console.");
}
```

This behavior can be used to our advantage as early return statements. Sometimes we want to execute
certain parts of our code only if a condition applies. We can check this with an if else statement.
When multiple conditions are in place, the code becomes harder to read and to understand:

```js
function setBackgroundColor(color) {
  if (typeof color === "String") {
    if (color.startsWith("#")) {
      if (color.length >= 7) {
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

An alternative approach is to terminate the function with early return statements:

```js
function setBackgroundColor(color) {
	// first condition
	if(typeOf color !== 'String') {
		return;
	}

	// second condition
	if(!color.startsWith('#')) {
		return;
	}

	// third condition
	if(color.length < 7) {
		return;
	}

	// only if all 3 conditions are passed the final line of code is executed.
	body.style.backgroundColor = color;
}

```

This way of writing the code is more readable

💡 Hint: A return statement can be left empty, the returned value is then `undefined`.

## Arrow Function Expressions

Next to the classic function declaration, JavaScript has a second way to write functions as
`arrow function expressions`:

```js
const addNumbers = (first, second) => {
  return first + second;
};
```

The function is saved like a variable with the keyword `const`. The parameters are written normally
in round brackets followed by an fat arrow `=>`. Then the function body is written in curly
brackets.

### Implicit Return Statements

The advantage of arrow functions are possible shorter notations when certain criteria apply:

1. Omit the round brackets around the parameters: This is possible, if there is only one input:
   ```js
   const addOne = (number) => {
     return number + 1;
   };
   ```
2. Implicit return statements: If the function consists only of a return statement, the curly
   brackets and the return keyword can be omitted:
   ```js
   const addNumbers = (first, second) => {
     return first + second;
   };
   ```
   can be rewritten as:
   ```js
   const addNumbers = (first, second) => first + second;
   ```

> 💡 This shorthand notation comes in handy as soon as we work with callback functions in a few
> days. So try to remember this feature.

> 💡 Maybe you remember the syntax of the `addEventListener` method. We encountered these arrow
> functions there already!
>
> ```js
> button.addEventListener('click',() => {
> 	...
> })
> ```

## Bonus Material

Here is some extra information about _**callback functions**_. While this knowledge isn't necessary for today's challenges, it's offered as a reference in case you encounter this term during your learning journey.

## Callback Functions

A callback function is a function that is passed **as an argument** into another function.

The outer function can execute this callback function at the correct moment or multiple times, for
example:

- when an event is triggered
- when the fetched data arrived on your computer
- for each element in an array.

Callback functions are used, whenever the program itself needs to figure out **when** or **how many
times** the function needs to be executed. We already used callback functions in **event
listeners**:

```js
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("Inside the callback function.");
});
```

Here the structure is as follows:

- outer function: `addEventListener()`
- first argument: `'click'`
- second argument: callback function
  ```js
  () => {
    console.log("Inside the callback function.");
  };
  ```

This type of function is called **anonymous function**, since it is declared without giving it a
name.

## Named Callback Functions

Any function can be used as a callback function. It just needs to be passed to another function. You
can declare a normal function and then use the **name of the function** to pass it into another
function:

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hey Dude!");
}

button.addEventListener("click", sayHello);
```

> ❗️ Note that we do not call the function here (we wrote `sayHello` instead of `sayHello()`). We
> only pass the function to the event listener. The function is only called when the event happens.

## Parameters in Callback Functions

A callback function can accept parameters. The values for the parameters are provided by the
function, that calls the callback function (the "higher order function").

In this example the callback function can accept a parameter to retrieve information about the
occurred event:

```js
button.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  console.log("This button was clicked:", event.target);
});
```
