# Self Directed Learning Week 1

The Thursday afternoon is dedicated to self-directed learning. This means the students can decide freely which topics they want to recap and practice.

However some students find it helpful to have some guidance and suggestions on what to do. Therefore we provide **optional** challenges that the students can work on.

Find a template for a Slack message [here](self-directed-learning-week-1.md). Alternatively push the file to the students repository.

Feel free to add more options according to the needs of your students.
For example:

- create a link to the [discussions board](https://github.com/orgs/neuefische/discussions/categories/web-self-directed-learning) for questions that can be added by the students.
- add a link to helpful video that you recommend
- add a link to an article that concludes a difficult topic of the week
