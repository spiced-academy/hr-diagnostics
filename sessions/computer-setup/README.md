# Computer Setup

## Session Guide

Welcome to the computer setup session! In this session, we'll ensure that all students have their computers configured properly for the bootcamp. Here's a guide on what to do:

### Installation Guide

- Show the students where to find the [installation guide](https://github.com/spicedacademy/web-protocol-template/blob/main/installation.md).
- Emphasize that their first task of the bootcamp is to read the guide and follow the instructions. Assure them that you're available to help with any questions they may have.
- Once students finish installing all necessary software, they can start with the challenge of the morning session.

### Verification of Installations

  Once all students have finished the installation process, we'll verify that they have completed everything correctly.

  1. **Github config:**
      - Guide students on creating a folder named `spiced-bootcamp`.
      - Show them how to clone their repository `cohort-web-dev` into this folder.

  2. **Test Challenge:**

      - After successful repository setup, provide the next command for students to run. This command includes a test challenge to verify that they have configured their tokens correctly.

      ```bash
      npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/computer-setup/is-token-correct
      ```
