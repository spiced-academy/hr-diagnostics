# Review w. Spearmint

- very slow paced session compared to challenging tasks (task 3 and 4)
- could at least already introduce return values
  - I would do all the stuff of functions 1 and 2 in one session
- more tasks/more difficult tasks imo
- in the afternoon: explain concept of hoisting --> works for functions with function keyword, but not for functions with const keyword
- challenges were hard on the other side
