# General review regarding curriculum

- ~~Don't use CodeSandbox and use only the script that downloads stuff locally~~ (**DONE**)
  - ~~lets remove codesandbox links from the challenges and everywhere else~~ (**DONE**)
- **Maybe** combine **SOME** session in the first or second week.

- Add information how difficult each challenge is (difficulty: üå∂Ô∏è). Teacher of the session can just add it behind the challenges

- Use JSX file extensions for files where jsx is used!

- Potentially for the future: replace CRA with Vite??

## react state 2

- demo example is confusing to the students; need a better, clearer one
- readme is confused and contradictory; it uses both input change event and form submit event; should rather stick to one.
