## Workflow during the Capstone Phase

- User Stories ‚û°Ô∏è Pull Requests ‚û°Ô∏è Code Reviews ‚û°Ô∏è Quality Assurance
- **Agile Workflow**: Your Kanban board as well as your User Stories aren't just mandatory, but actually helpful!
- **You have to manage your own time - so make sure to allocate some time to organize!**

---

<!-- _class: small -->

## Sprint Preparation & User Story **#user-stories**

- Write your user story and move it to the **Backlog** column of your board.
- After writing the User Story, post it in the **#user-stories** Slack Channel.
- When reviewing a fellow student's user story, please follow the following process:
  - in review: üëÄ
  - changes requested: ‚úîÔ∏è
  - approved: ‚úÖ
  - Coaches Veto: ‚òùÔ∏è _Coaches Only_
- Changes applied? Post the updated user story to the **#user-stories** Slack channel.
- Once approved, move your user story to the **Sprint** column of your board.
- Reviews need to be done in chronological order - no cherry-picking!

## Working on a User Story

- If you're working on implementing a user story, make sure to move it to the **In Progress** column of your Kanban board.
- Before you start, make sure that you are on the `main` branch of your local repository.
- Use `git pull`, just in case. Make sure that your `main` branch is up to date.
- Create a new branch for your new feature, e.g. `feature/navigation`.
- While you're working on your code, make sure to create reasonably small commits.
- Implement the **Tasks** as declared in your user story.
- Make sure to keep track of your **acceptance criteria**.

---

<!-- _class: small -->

## Pull Requests & Code Reviews **#code-reviews**

- Create a pull request (short: **PR**).
- Make sure that the PR has a concise and useful title.
  - Superstar Devs link back to the respective User Story!
- Don't add any collaborators/assignees/reviewers or message anyone directly!
- Post the link to your PR in the Slack channel **#code-reviews**.
- Move the respective user story on your Kanban board to the column **Code Review**.

---

<!-- _class: small -->

## Pull Requests & Code Reviews **#code-reviews**

- When reviewing a PR, make sure to follow the usual process:
  - in review: üëÄ
  - changes requested: ‚úîÔ∏è
  - approved: ‚úÖ
  - Coaches Veto: ‚òùÔ∏è _Coaches Only_
- If changes were requested and you applied them successfully, make sure to post the updated PR again.
- **You can only merge your PR _AFTER_ the process of Quality Assurance is complete, not before.** The only exception to this rule is when QA is not useful or necessary (after refactoring code, etc).
- Reviews are still done in chronological order - no cherry-picking here, either.

## Quality Assurance **#quality-assurance**

- After your code has been reviewed, post the link to your deployment (on Vercel) to the **#quality-assurance** Slack Channel.
- Make sure to briefly describe the feature that has been implemented.
- Move your User Story to the column **quality assurance / QA** on your Kanban board.
- While assuring a feature's quality, make sure to follow the usual process:
  - in review: üëÄ
  - changes requested: ‚úîÔ∏è
  - approved: ‚úÖ
  - Coaches Veto: ‚òùÔ∏è _Coaches Only_
- Please leave the feedback in the responses to the respective thread.
- As per usual, the order is strictly chronological.

---

<!-- _class: small -->

## Quality Assurance Housekeeping

- If the feedback requires changes that need to be made, **the code will have to be reviewed again!**
- The User Story will move back to **In Progess** then move on to **Code Review** and finally **Quality Assurance / QA**.
- The PR will follow the same stations.

---

<!-- _class: small -->

## After Quality Assurance Approval

- Once the PR has made it through quality assurance without any issues, the PR can be merged.
- Once everything is approved and merged, you can move the User Story to the **Done** column of your Kanban board.
- **Now you can move on to your next User Story!**

Capstone Tips

<!-- _class: small -->

## Capstone Project Tips

- **Code Quality** is more important than the total number of features.
- **KISS** _Keep It Simple Stupid_ e.g. try to avoid implementing unnecessary technologies.
- **CRUD operations**:
  - **Create** -> add
  - **Read** -> display
  - **Update** -> edit
  - **Delete** -> remove

When in doubt, refer to **CRUD**.

## Workflow Tips

- **Kill your Darlings:** Sometimes you have to abandon an ideal solution for a working one.
- **Dog Days are okay:** Everyone has a bad day sometimes, don't get discouraged.
- **Expectation Managment:** Sometimes we need to adjust our expectations.
- **Ownership & Independence:** Try to find your own solutions and act responsibly.
- **Reviews, Reviews, Reviews:** Make sure to allocate time for reviewing other students' User Stories, PRs, QAs.
- **Teamwork makes the dream work:** No developer is an island! Make sure to work as a team and support each other!
